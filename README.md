# IPS Services Runer Demo

**NOTE: This is a demonstration of a prototype.  Bugs and issues are expected and the API _will_ change**

## Overview

This repository allows you to download, build, run and seed all the IPS-related services:

* [Inferno Community](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/tree/ips)
* [Dynamic FHIR Server](https://github.com/inferno-community/dynamic-fhir-servers/tree/ips_artifacts)
* [Client FHIR Proxy](https://github.com/inferno-community/client-fhir-testing/tree/dockerize)
* [Inferno Validation Service](https://github.com/inferno-community/fhir-validator-wrapper)

To run it:

```shell
  ./build_ips.sh
```

Confirm your desire to do each step by hitting Enter

Once it says `IPS services are now running!`, you're ready to go!
